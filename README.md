# LowestCommonAncestor-Java
Initially tested DAG for LCA implentation in new branch "DAGLca".
Wrote Junit tests to test DAG LCA. 
Created DAGLca to add DAG Lowest Common Ancestor Implementaion.
Added futher tests to "DAGLcaTest" to test DAG Lowest Common Ancestor Implementaion 

# Merging 
After DAG Lca implementation, merged master branch with "DAGLca" branch. After merging added back the files for
lowest common ancestor previously implemented.
